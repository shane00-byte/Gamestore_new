# Game Store Management System

A desktop application built with Python and Tkinter for managing a game and console store inventory. It connects to a MySQL database and provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, along with data visualization for key metrics.

## ✨ Features

* **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete records for both games and consoles.
* **Automatic Database Setup:** On first run, the app automatically creates the `game` database and the required `gamestore` and `console` tables.
* **Automatic Schema Migration:** The app intelligently checks if new columns (like `monthly_users` and `total_revenue`) exist and automatically adds them to the tables if they are missing.
* **Data Visualization:** Instantly generate `matplotlib` charts based on the current data:
    * **Pie Chart:** Visualize the distribution of **Monthly Users** per product.
    * **Bar Chart:** Compare the **Total Revenue** generated by each product.
* **Tabbed Interface:** A simple-to-use interface lets you switch between managing "Games" and "Consoles" with a single click.
* **Safe Operations:** All create, update, and delete actions require user confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Tkinter:** For the graphical user interface (GUI).
* **mysql-connector-python:** For all MySQL database interactions.
* **Matplotlib:** For generating pie and bar charts.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Python 3:** Make sure Python 3 is installed. (Tkinter is typically included with Python).
* **MySQL Server:** You must have a MySQL server running (e.g., via XAMPP, WAMP, Docker, or a local service).

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python matplotlib
````

### 3\. Configure Database Connection

This is the most important step. Open the Python script and **edit the `DB_CONFIG` dictionary** at the top of the file to match your local MySQL server credentials.

```python
# ------------------ CONFIG ------------------ #
DB_CONFIG = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",         # <-- Change to your MySQL username
    "port": 3306,
    "password": "1234",     # <-- Change to your MySQL password
    "database": "game"
}
```

The script will automatically create the `game` database, so you don't need to do it manually.

## 🏃 How to Run

Once you have configured your `DB_CONFIG`, simply run the Python script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

1.  The application window will open.
2.  Click **"Games"** or **"Consoles"** to load the data from the respective table.
3.  Use the action buttons (**Insert**, **Update**, **Delete**, **Refresh**) to manage your inventory.
4.  Click **"Pie Chart"** or **"Bar Chart"** to visualize the data for the table you are currently viewing.
